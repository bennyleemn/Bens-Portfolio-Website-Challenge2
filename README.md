# Bens-Portfolio-Website-Challenge2
A website for my portfolio
Description: Create a website for class to track progress, help hone my basic skills and essentially, set me up to link out to the things I create or collaborate on during the course.

Link to deployed site: check it out --> [ ()]

Link to repo: 

Contributors: Slack or Discord Study Groups - Michael I., Caesar R., Sarah B., TA's (Akon/Quinton)

Motivation: To learn the basics of semantic html, css styling and web development. This is the first step on a journey I am taking to become a developer.

Why did you build this project: Building this out so I can get better at starting from scratch, finding out how different data points (elements, commands, etc) interact between the html, css, assets (docs/images).
